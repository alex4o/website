Although there are other options for running automatically running GraphQL queries on PostgreSQL, Hasura looks pretty promising. 

- [supabase](https://supabase.io/)
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)
- [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/)
- [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/)

These are headless CMS systems that support graphql and are open source (Self-hosted).

- [strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) node.js
- [Sanity](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity) node.js
- [Directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) node.js has a version that was in PHP
- [Squidex](https://github.com/Squidex/squidex) uses .net instead of node.js

These are projects that replace `airtable` but can also be headless CMS es.

- [nocodb](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb)
- [baserow](https://gitlab.com/bramw/baserow)

This project can be useful to create admin panels easily
