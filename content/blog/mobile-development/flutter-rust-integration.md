# Getting Flutter rusty

Using native libraries more easily, and doing your state management in rust. All kf these things can be achieved using [RiD](https://thlorenz.com/rid-site/) or Rust in Dart. It uses Dart's ffi to generate rust bindings that can be used from Flutter. 

The primary reason for the creation of this project was to, do your state management in Rust which is very similar to [Elm.js](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).

It can also be used to integrate with native crates that are unavailable as Flutter libraries.
